# Task lifecycle model-check suite

Zoo Code checks task lifecycle protocols through one umbrella command for independent bounded checks. Run the complete suite locally with:

```sh
pnpm lifecycle:model-check
```

The baseline command runs seven independent bounded checks in sequence:

1. the persisted task delegation lifecycle;
2. shared-store concurrency across task-history hosts;
3. production-backed handoff reducers with an abstract provider/scheduler protocol;
4. the task cleanup protocol;
5. request-stream parser scoping;
6. completion persistence; and
7. delegated-mode reader refinement.

The planned two-sibling fan-out protocol is intentionally outside the baseline and CI umbrella. Run it explicitly with `pnpm fanout-protocol:model-check`; it describes optional future functionality, not current production coverage.

This umbrella command is the single model-check entry point in the `compile` CI job after type checking. Command-level composition does not merge the submodels' state spaces: each checker retains its own bounds, transitions, invariant ownership, reachability requirements, and counterexample format. In particular, parser state is not part of the persisted lifecycle graph. The focused parser checker remains directly runnable with `pnpm parser-scope:model-check` for debugging.

An individual checker fails if it finds an invariant violation, a modeled action becomes unreachable, a named semantic landmark disappears, or exploration exceeds its declared state budget. A lifecycle violation includes the shortest breadth-first event trace, every intermediate state, and the active bounds so the sequence can be replayed as a focused regression test.

A checker printing `passed` means only that its configured bounded invariants, expected witnesses, reachability requirements, and state budget succeeded. It does not close a linked issue, prove arbitrary-task correctness, or establish refinement for production consumers that the checker does not execute.

Executable cross-model composition should be added only when a correctness claim genuinely spans two or more submodels and there is an explicit, production-grounded boundary mapping between their events or state. That composition must state a bounded joint exploration strategy and own cross-model invariants that cannot be proved within either child model alone. Shared command orchestration or conceptual adjacency is not sufficient reason to multiply independent state spaces.

## Why an executable TypeScript model

The models use small explicit-state explorers rather than adding Quint, TLA+/TLC, or Alloy. This is deliberate:

- Zoo's current risks are finite safety properties over a small persisted state machine, not yet temporal liveness or fairness properties.
- The delegation and shared-store explorers call production transition functions from `src/core/task-persistence`. `ClineProvider` uses those same functions inside serialized and atomic store operations, reducing specification drift for those protocols.
- Breadth-first exploration gives a deterministic, shortest-by-event counterexample with no Java or separate specification toolchain.
- Bounds and budget exhaustion are explicit. CI never reports a truncated exploration as a pass.

This follows the same initial-state, next-state, reachable-state, invariant structure described by the [TLA+ high-level view](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/high-level-view.html) and [Quint's model-checker documentation](https://quint-lang.org/docs/model-checkers). The implementation connection is important: Quint's [model-based testing guidance](https://quint-lang.org/docs/model-based-testing) notes that checking a specification alone does not show that production code implements it.

TLA+/PlusCal or Quint with TLC becomes a better fit when the lifecycle needs temporal properties, fairness assumptions, unbounded queues, or refinement between protocol layers. Alloy is better suited if relational ownership structure becomes harder than event ordering; Alloy analyses are explicitly bounded by scope, as described in the [Alloy tutorial](https://alloytools.org/tutorials/online/maintext-FS-1.html). Randomized model-based testing can complement, but not replace, the exhaustive bounded check when a production adapter is available; [fast-check documents command models](https://fast-check.dev/docs/advanced/model-based-testing/) and [controlled Promise scheduling](https://fast-check.dev/docs/advanced/race-conditions/). Jepsen-style history checking remains useful for distributed persistence behavior, but is heavier than this in-process lifecycle protocol; see Jepsen's [consistency model overview](https://jepsen.io/consistency).

The model has three fixed task slots, enough to cover competing siblings and a nested parent-child-grandchild chain, plus one abstract boolean per slot recording whether an active child's session is owned by another window (recent history-file mtime). It explores every reachable interleaving through depth 12, deduplicating canonical states. Representative checks also exercise rejected operations that do not create a new state: a second concurrent delegation while the first child is active, stale completion after re-delegation, late completion after abandonment, completion after interruption, and nested completion. Named semantic landmarks require the graph to retain interrupted-child re-delegation and nested delegation even when the raw state total changes, a delegated parent whose active child is live in another window surviving startup reconciliation unchanged, and a stale-mtime (crash-orphan) active child being repaired to `interrupted` with the parent returned to `active` only through `reconcileStartup`.

Production completion also accepts a recovery-compatible `active` parent that still awaits the returning child, then clears the stale pointers. Normal model transitions never create that intermediate state, so it is covered by a focused reducer test rather than admitted as a generally valid reachable state.

## Shared-store concurrency model

The same `pnpm lifecycle:model-check` command also runs a second bounded explorer over two `TaskHistoryStore` hosts. It imports the production `computeHistoryDelta` and `mergeHistoryDelta` functions, so its semantics match the store rather than assuming coherent caches or transactional pair writes:

- each host has an independent cache and host-local mutex;
- store read/update operations hold the host mutex, while live-task snapshots used by completion and message saves may outlive it;
- a write delta is computed relative to that host's cache;
- revalidation under the per-file disk lock checks only status-transition legality;
- fields absent from the delta preserve the current disk value, `childIds` are unioned, and other same-field conflicts are last-writer-wins;
- `atomicUpdatePair` commits its files in order, with another host able to act between file commits;
- successful pair-operation cache entries publish together after both file writes; if the second write fails, the cache publishes only the first committed record;
- cache refresh is explicit and may occur after an external live-task snapshot was captured.

There is no production record version or compare-and-swap token today. The model therefore does not invent one. It checks host-mutex and file-lock ownership, whole-file delta rejection, disk-field preservation, `childIds` union, and pair write order in every state reachable within six bounded scenarios. Those scenarios include distinct-task writes from #920 and a second-write pair failure, and all seven phases (`read`, `prepare`, `revalidate`, `commit`, `refresh`, `reject`, and `fail`) must remain reachable without exceeding the state/depth budgets. Positive semantic landmarks additionally require a stale cache beside newer disk state, the first pair write committed while the second is pending, and the same committed prefix retained after the second write fails.

Two desired properties are currently false and remain issue-keyed shortest-witness ratchets rather than silently allowed assertion failures:

- [#1469](https://github.com/Zoo-Code-Org/Zoo-Code/issues/1469): an old completion can commit after a newer handoff and clear it because disk revalidation checks status legality, not exact-child ownership.
- [#1021](https://github.com/Zoo-Code-Org/Zoo-Code/issues/1021): after abandonment and cache refresh, a stale live-task save can preserve the new interrupted status while restoring old lineage fields.

CI fails if either exact causal witness or violation class changes, a witness disappears without being promoted to a universal invariant, a named semantic landmark or modeled phase becomes unreachable, a new safety violation appears, or exploration truncates. Raw reachable-state totals are printed as diagnostics, not used as ratchets: harmless representation changes can alter them without weakening protocol coverage.

The known-unsafe witnesses currently compare exact shortest action sequences. This is intentionally simple and reviewable, but brittle to harmless action renames or serialization refactors. A causal partial-order comparator would reduce that brittleness but would add a second trace-equivalence protocol to maintain. Until that complexity is justified, update an exact witness only after confirming the terminal violation class and required causal ordering are unchanged.

`TaskHistoryStore.realConcurrency.spec.ts` complements the abstract interleavings with one synchronized integration smoke check through the real `proper-lockfile` and filesystem rename path; broader VS Code E2E remains reserved for restart and extension-host behavior.

## Task cleanup protocol model

The umbrella command also runs a separate bounded child model for in-memory abort, disposal, and provider-shutdown ordering. It models cleanup settlement and rejection as environment transitions and makes no filesystem, editor Promise, fairness, or timing-liveness claim. See [Task cleanup protocol model check](./task-cleanup-protocol-model.md).

## Provider handoff and scheduler model

`scripts/check-provider-handoff-scheduler.ts` is a separate bounded adapter model for the runtime boundary that the persisted lifecycle graph does not represent. Its breadth-first explorer normalizes provider-keyed records and owner arrays before deduplicating canonical states, then exhaustively explores enabled action orderings through depth 15 with a 20,000-state budget. It imports `selectHandoffExecutionContext` and the existing `delegateTaskToChild` and `completeDelegatedChild` reducers. A direct saved, unsaved, and locked-profile matrix checks task-local configuration selection within those cases. Stale provider lookup is caught before this pure selector, so focused provider tests check the failed lookup, contextual log, and fallback. The protocol state then models two provider instances, their claims and parent snapshots, authoritative parent/child records, current task publication, commit/start ownership, the child scheduler permit, queued and resumed parent state, and one bounded redelegation generation.

Provider locking, paused-child/current-task publication, and semaphore admission/release are explicit model abstractions rather than imported production code. Focused provider and `TaskScheduler` tests cover those concrete adapters. Lifecycle commits and completion use the real reducers. Parent publication and its queued continuation share an explicit transition owner: the fixed policy retains that ownership through matching resume invocation, then models the resumed run settling outside transition ownership. This permits a new delegation generation to begin while the prior resumed run remains active without allowing a stale continuation to start across the newer transition. The fixed policy checks every successor for continuous publication, one child start and commit per generation, exact commit-before-start ownership, permit release before parent resume or redelegation, matching parent transition/continuation ownership at resume invocation, and consistent final child/parent publication. It also requires both resume phases, every other action, and named semantic landmarks to remain reachable and fails if the depth boundary has an unseen successor.

Six injected legacy transition policies must produce deterministic shortest counterexamples through the same explorer: start before commit, resume before permit release, redelegation before permit release, empty current-task publication, two stale provider commits from competing snapshots, and releasing parent-transition serialization immediately after publication. The last witness must causally include first-child completion and parent publication, a second-child commit, release of the first child's scheduler permit, and then the stale first-child continuation. The checker prints the distinct reachable-state count, complete scenario/action/landmark coverage, bounds, and each named counterexample trace. It deliberately does not add a WAL, global profile projection, or scheduler state to persisted `HistoryItem` records.

For #921, the execution-context matrix checks saved, unsaved, and locked profile selection at the handoff boundary. For that bounded matrix, it establishes only that delegation writes the requested task-local mode and cloned configuration into the child context. It does not prove that every downstream consumer reads that context. The checker retains a divergent-mode witness in which the child task mode differs from the shared provider mode so reader refinements can demonstrate that choosing the wrong source is observable.

Merged PR #1625 changed the confirmed downstream readers: `getEnvironmentDetails` obtains `cline.getTaskMode()`, `presentAssistantMessage` passes that task-local mode to `validateToolUse`, and custom tool execution receives the same task-local mode. Focused production tests cover those three paths.

`scripts/check-delegated-mode-readers.ts` does not execute `getEnvironmentDetails`, `presentAssistantMessage`, or `validateToolUse`. It checks the production handoff selector and a pure built-in-mode permission divergence, establishing that the wrong source is observable. It is refinement support, not exhaustive reader coverage. Other mode-sensitive consumers remain an explicit inventory gap, and this suite does not claim universal task-local reader isolation.

## Task fan-out protocol model

`scripts/check-task-fanout-protocol.ts` is a separate, optional bounded protocol model for the #369/#372 fan-out safety contract. It explores a live parent with two sibling slots, a two-permit scheduler, independent result readiness, explicit child-to-parent delivery, parent loss, orphan cancellation, and permit release. It checks scheduler capacity and exact permit ownership, one writer and at-most-once delivery per child, readiness before delivery, and no result routing after parent loss. Named landmarks require concurrent siblings beneath a live parent, out-of-order result delivery, single-writer results, parent loss while work is running, and complete orphan cleanup to remain reachable. Injected unsafe states confirm those invariants reject wrong writers, early and duplicate delivery, post-parent-loss routing, and scheduler over-allocation.

This model checks an intended abstract composition boundary without claiming that concurrent sibling fan-out is enabled in production. It imports no production fan-out transition and is excluded from `pnpm lifecycle:model-check` and baseline CI. `TaskScheduler` provides generic bounded permits, but `ClineProvider` constructs it at the default capacity of one and production delegation persists a singular `awaitingChildId`. Raising production concurrency still requires live-parent result integration and extension-host coverage before fan-out can ship.

The production-backed lifecycle checker already models the current serial ownership invariant: a parent has at most one `awaitingChildId`, `delegatedToId` matches it, and every active/delegated linked child is the child currently awaited. The reducer rejects re-delegation while that child is active. This is exhaustive only for the checker's three slots and depth 12 and does not erase the documented cross-host stale-write violations, so baseline closure still requires their production fixes and model promotion.

## Completion persistence model

`scripts/check-completion-persistence.ts` models the completion-readiness protocol that protects the public `TaskCompleted` event. It starts from both standalone and delegated tasks and exhaustively interleaves:

- starting, finishing, or failing the assistant-history write;
- accepting completion before, during, or after persistence;
- scheduling a bounded retry, completing its delay, and starting the retry write;
- exhausting retries;
- cancellation or disposal at every reachable non-completed state;
- delegated parent reopen success or failure after durable child history; and
- emitting completion.

The model abstracts restart visibility as the `durable` history phase. It allows an already-started write to finish after cancellation because the filesystem operation itself is not cancellable, but it forbids starting a retry write or emitting completion after cancellation. The retry bound is two write starts (the initial attempt plus one retry), which is sufficient to cover the ordering and cancellation state classes without mirroring the production retry count.

Seven semantic landmarks keep the intended positive and negative paths reachable: delayed completion remains pending, failed completion remains pending, exhausted retries settle without completion, cancellation can win after retry delay but before persistence, delegated reopen failure emits no delegated completion, and both standalone and delegated tasks can complete after durable history. The checker explores all reachable states through depth 10 and fails rather than reporting a truncated pass if an unseen successor remains.

## Invariants

The task delegation checker currently enforces:

1. A delegated parent has exactly one `awaitingChildId`, and `delegatedToId` matches it.
2. The awaited child exists, links back to the parent, is not completed, and remains in `childIds`. A delegated child may itself await a nested child.
3. Non-delegated parents retain no active delegation pointer.
4. Every active or delegated linked child is the child its parent currently awaits. An interrupted prior child may retain lineage after re-delegation but cannot complete back into that parent.
5. Parent-child lineage is acyclic.
6. Completed task records cannot be changed by later lifecycle events.
7. Active-child re-delegation, stale completion after ownership moves to another child, duplicate/late completion, and abandonment of a live child are rejected by the shared production guards.
8. No transition may clear a delegated parent's link to a child that is active and marked live-elsewhere (`ModelState.liveElsewhere` true); reconciliation repairs the link only when that flag is false. This encodes the PR #1495 cross-window misrepair bug class, which broke delegation links so subtask completion could not return to the parent.

The completion persistence checker additionally enforces:

1. `TaskCompleted` requires accepted completion and restart-visible assistant history.
2. Delayed, failed, and retry-exhausted persistence cannot emit completion.
3. Cancellation or disposal settles the modeled readiness wait, clears pending retry state, starts no later retry write, and emits no completion.
4. Delegated completion crosses the same durability boundary as standalone completion and requires successful parent reopen.
5. A failed delegated parent reopen cannot emit the delegated completion event.

These are safety claims within the documented bounds. The checks do not claim liveness, fairness, power-loss durability, filesystem-lock correctness, or exhaustive coverage of arbitrary task counts or retry counts. The completion explorer specifies the event contract rather than importing `Task` or `AttemptCompletionTool`; focused unit tests and the restart E2E verify that concrete production paths implement the modeled guards. Delegated reopen is abstracted as one success-or-failure event after durable child history; fallback from a failed reopen into the normal standalone completion flow remains production-test coverage rather than part of this model. The lifecycle checker also does not distinguish a delayed pre-interruption completion from a legitimate post-resume completion for the same child ID; that requires a persisted attempt/generation token before it can become a sound invariant.

The production mapping above names primary lifecycle transitions, not every mutation or consumer. Generic store upserts, reconciliation, repair replay, migrations, tool entry points, webview/public API abandonment, provider status updates, and public `TaskCompleted` re-emission remain outside the persisted reducer graph unless explicitly named by a submodel or focused test. For task-local mode, the consumers named under #921/#1623 are a confirmed set, not an exhaustive repository-wide inventory; other mode-sensitive tools must be audited before claiming universal reader isolation.

CI runs `pnpm lifecycle:model-check` in `.github/workflows/code-qa.yml` after lint and type checking. Extension-host subtask and restart-persistence E2E run separately; a green umbrella command therefore says nothing about an omitted E2E boundary or an unmodeled downstream consumer.

## Gap audit

This section is a summary tracker. Issue links are historical provenance rather than specifications. Coverage status uses these evidence classes:

The [Task lifecycle verification GAP report](./task-lifecycle-gap-report.md) is the authoritative register. It holds the exhaustive repository inventory, the ranked stable burn-down register, the source-based methodology, and the follow-up checklist. This page remains the executable model-suite specification.

- **Production-backed bounded:** exhaustive only for the declared state space while executing production functions.
- **Abstract bounded:** exhaustive only for model-authored transitions; refinement depends on separate adapter tests.
- **Known-unsafe witness:** CI preserves a reproducible violation and does not claim the property holds.
- **Proxy/partial:** evidence covers a premise, adapter, or representative path, not the full claim.

| Cross-host completion ownership      | A completion may mutate a parent only while that parent authoritatively awaits the same child.                                    | **Known-unsafe witness** plus a production-backed reducer guard.                                                                            | The reducer rejects stale authoritative input, but disk revalidation checks status legality rather than exact-child ownership. A stale host can orphan the newer child.                               | Revalidate exact ownership under the disk lock; add deterministic two-store regression coverage; replace the expected witness with a universal bounded invariant.                       |
| Monotonic detachment                 | Message persistence must never restore lineage after abandonment clears it.                                                       | **Known-unsafe witness** plus a production-backed detach reducer.                                                                           | A live task rebuilds lineage from stale fields; a later delta can restore parent/root IDs while preserving the interrupted status.                                                                    | Give lifecycle fields a disk-authoritative write owner or tombstone/generation; prove stale metadata saves cannot alter them; promote the witness to an invariant.                      |
| Task-local mode consumers            | Every mode-sensitive child operation must use the child task's immutable mode, not shared provider/view state.                    | Write side: **production-backed bounded matrix**. Three confirmed readers: **focused production tests**. Reader checker: **proxy/partial**. | The merged fix covers environment rendering, built-in validation, and custom-tool execution. The pure checker does not execute them, and other provider-mode readers are not exhaustively classified. | Complete the reader inventory, add focused divergent-mode evidence for each required task-local consumer, and enforce a task-local reader boundary before claiming universal isolation. |
| Tool-originated child initialization | Every required child field originating in `new_task` must be task-scoped, durably owned, and equivalent after rehydration.        | Argument forwarding has focused tests; durable initial-state refinement is **unmodeled**.                                                   | Normal creation uses explicit model-supplied child todos rather than copying the parent, but initial todos demonstrate that some child state is process-local and can disappear.                      | Inventory all child initialization fields; define durable ownership, deep-copy, precedence, publication, and rehydration contracts with focused and E2E checks (`LIFE-GAP-035`).        |
| Tool approval ownership              | An interactive edit or settlement may affect only the matching task, action, and tool call.                                       | Single-approval behavior has focused tests; cross-task correlation is **unmodeled and known unsafe by inspection**.                         | `update_todo_list` uses process-global edit state without task/action identity, allowing delayed or concurrent approval contamination.                                                                | Correlate proposal/edit/approval/cancellation by task and action/tool-call ID; reject stale edits and test interleavings (`LIFE-GAP-036`).                                              |
| Tool partial-state isolation         | Partial presentation state must be owned by one task and tool call and cleared on every terminal path.                            | Tool-local tests only; cross-call/task interleavings are **unmodeled**.                                                                     | Singleton handlers share `lastSeenPartialPath`, so another call can create false or missed path stabilization.                                                                                        | Key state by `(taskId, toolCallId)` or instantiate handlers per call; test interleavings and cleanup (`LIFE-GAP-037`).                                                                  |
| Tool identity correspondence         | Parsed call, durable history, approval, execution, result, pending action, and replay must have one collision-resistant identity. | Duplicate-ID helper tests are **proxy/partial**; end-to-end correspondence is **unmodeled**.                                                | Non-injective sanitization can collapse distinct raw IDs in history while execution still treats them as separate calls.                                                                              | Reject/disambiguate collisions and prove a one-to-one identity mapping across native/MCP calls and restart (`LIFE-GAP-038`).                                                            |
| Serial delegation baseline           | Current production permits one awaited active child per parent and resumes the parent only after child release.                   | Singular ownership is **production-backed bounded**; scheduler/provider ordering is mixed production/abstract.                              | Reducers and the normal provider path enforce singular ownership, but stale cross-host persistence can still violate the relationship; scheduler capacity is defaulted, not statically fixed.         | Close current serial persistence/ordering gaps and ratchet the provider's one-permit baseline. Treat fan-out as separate optional scope.                                                |
| Shared lifecycle status vocabulary   | All consumers should derive task status from one exported owner.                                                                  | **Type/static convention**; the visible interrupted-status symptom is repaired.                                                             | Persistence derives its alias from `HistoryItem`, but CLI history adapters still copy the union, allowing future drift.                                                                               | Export one shared status type, consume it at CLI/persistence boundaries, and rely on typechecking or a static rule to reject copied incompatible vocabulary.                            |
| Cross-model refinement               | No independent checker result may be combined into a stronger end-to-end claim without an executable boundary mapping.            | **Explicit limitation** only.                                                                                                               | Persistence, provider publication, parser scope, cleanup, and completion durability run as separate state spaces; omitted consumers can violate a premise after another checker passes.               | Add production-grounded boundary events and a bounded joint strategy for each genuinely cross-model invariant, or keep claims explicitly local.                                         |
| Completion event consumers           | Public completion must not be treated as universally durable beyond the modeled readiness contract.                               | **Abstract bounded** model plus focused tests and one fresh-host E2E path.                                                                  | The model abstracts durability and parent reopen; provider status metadata and downstream `TaskCompleted` consumers are outside its state.                                                            | Inventory downstream consumers and add refinement checks only for guarantees they require; retain power-loss, filesystem, retry-count, and liveness exclusions.                         |

## Extending the model

When production lifecycle behavior changes:

1. Define or update the pure transition in `taskLifecycle.ts`, then call it from the production operation.
2. Model the corresponding enabled event in `scripts/check-task-lifecycle.ts`.
3. Encode an invariant for the bug class, or a representative rejected-event scenario when the event intentionally leaves state unchanged.
4. Increase depth or task slots only when the new scenario requires it. Keep the state budget explicit and ensure CI completes quickly.
5. Convert any discovered counterexample into a focused production regression test as well as retaining the architectural invariant.

Completion-readiness changes belong in `scripts/check-completion-persistence.ts`; shared-store interleavings belong in `scripts/check-task-store-concurrency.ts`. Optional fan-out work belongs in `scripts/check-task-fanout-protocol.ts` and its separately scoped ticket until production transitions exist. Do not weaken bounds or remove an invariant merely to make CI pass. If state growth becomes difficult to control, split independent protocols or move the model to TLC/Quint with an implementation trace adapter rather than silently sampling the state space.

Parser request scoping is one such independent bounded submodel within the umbrella suite. Extend `scripts/check-native-tool-call-parser-scoping.ts` and its focused architecture document instead of adding parser state or transitions to `taskLifecycle.ts` or the persisted lifecycle state graph.

## Test layering

Keep reducer permutations in this model and focused Vitest suites. The real VS Code extension-host suite using a mocked provider in `apps/vscode-e2e/src/suite/subtasks.test.ts` already covers the boundaries the pure explorer cannot: task creation and rehydration, persisted parent-child state, cancellation during a delayed provider stream, interrupted-child resume, abandonment followed by a real resume/save/completion cycle, pending approvals across leave/return, and scheduler-driven resume. `restart-persistence.test.ts` separately verifies completion history through a fresh extension host.

Add E2E coverage only when a lifecycle change crosses one of those runtime boundaries or introduces a new one. For example, #1453 persistence-readiness semantics require a controlled fresh-host test, and #369/#372 fan-out requires scheduler permit, live-parent routing, orphan cleanup, and task-scoping E2E. Do not add E2E cases solely to replay reducer orderings already exhausted here; they increase fixture and timing cost without strengthening the proof claim.
