# Code-Light Task Report: Build and Install VSIX

## Task Summary
Switched to `feature/combined-all-features` branch, installed dependencies, built the VSIX package, and installed it in VS Code.

## Actions Taken

1. **Branch switch**: `git checkout feature/combined-all-features` — succeeded
2. **Dependency install**: `& "$env:APPDATA\npm\pnpm.cmd" install` — succeeded (lockfile up to date, 6.7s)
3. **Bundle**: `cd src; & "$env:APPDATA\npm\pnpm.cmd" run bundle` — succeeded (esbuild production bundle)
4. **VSIX packaging**: `cd src; npx @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies --out ../bin` — succeeded
   - Had to add `$env:APPDATA\npm` to `$env:PATH` first, since `vscode:prepublish` calls `pnpm` directly (not via full path)
   - Note: initial `pnpm run vsix` failed because `vsce package` triggers `vscode:prepublish` which calls bare `pnpm`, not in PATH
5. **VSIX install**: `code --install-extension "c:/Users/k1yt/OneDrive/Projects/ZooCode/bin/zoo-code-3.72.0.vsix" --force` — succeeded

## Result
✅ Success — VSIX built and installed.

**VSIX details**:
- File: `bin/zoo-code-3.72.0.vsix`
- Size: 33.16 MB (1932 files)
- Version: 3.72.0

## Issues Discovered
- `pnpm` is not in PATH on this system. The `vscode:prepublish` script calls `pnpm` directly, causing failures when invoked via `npm run`. Workaround: prepend `$env:APPDATA\npm` to `$env:PATH` before running vsce.

## Next Step Recommendations
- The extension is now installed. Reload VS Code window to activate.
- If the VSIX needs to be distributed, the file is at `bin/zoo-code-3.72.0.vsix`.

## Affected File List
- `bin/zoo-code-3.72.0.vsix` (generated)
- No source files modified
