## Issue: `read_file` indentation anchor exceeded the source file range

### Problem Description
- What happened: An indentation-mode read targeted line 620 in `src/api/providers/openai.ts`, but the file currently contains only 593 lines.
- When it occurred: During provider pipeline research for MiMo parallel tool-call handling.
- Error message: `anchor_line 620 is out of range (1-593)`.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Why it happened: The anchor was inferred from a related search context rather than an exact line result for this file.

### Workaround/Solution
- How I solved it: Continue with a semantic search for the exact method and then read from the returned line.
- What I tried: One indentation-mode read with the invalid anchor. It was not retried unchanged.

### Ideal Environment
- What would be ideal: Indentation-mode reads could clamp an oversized anchor to the final semantic block, or return a condensed symbol index with valid line anchors.

### Additional Notes
- No source code was modified.
