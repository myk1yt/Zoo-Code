# Code Task Report
## Task Summary
Added the test files validating `totalCost` calculation for PR B (fix(providers): add totalCost calculation).

## Actions Taken
1. Created [`src/api/providers/__tests__/openai-compatible.spec.ts`](src/api/providers/__tests__/openai-compatible.spec.ts:1) with the user-supplied tests covering:
   - `totalCost` > 0 when pricing is present
   - `totalCost` = 0 when no pricing is present
   - cached input tokens are factored into cost
   - `reasoningTokens` are preserved in the usage chunk
   - missing token counts default to 0
2. Appended the `processUsageMetrics totalCost` describe block to the end of the top-level `describe("OpenAiHandler", ...)` in [`src/api/providers/__tests__/openai.spec.ts`](src/api/providers/__tests__/openai.spec.ts:1496) with the user-supplied tests covering:
   - `totalCost` is present in the streaming usage chunk
   - `totalCost` is 0 when the model has no pricing
   - cache read/write tokens are reflected in the usage chunk and cost
3. Ran the targeted test suites for both files; all tests pass (71 passed).
4. Ran `tsc --noEmit` from `src/`. The only errors reported are pre-existing issues in [`src/api/providers/moonshot.ts`](src/api/providers/moonshot.ts:5) and [`src/api/providers/__tests__/moonshot.spec.ts`](src/api/providers/__tests__/moonshot.spec.ts:26), which reference the old `OpenAiCompatibleHandler`/`OpenAiCompatibleHandlerOptions` names that were removed from [`src/api/providers/openai-compatible.ts`](src/api/providers/openai-compatible.ts:51). No TypeScript errors originate from the two files modified in this task.

## Result
- ✅ New test file created successfully.
- ✅ Test block appended to existing OpenAI handler test file.
- ✅ Targeted vitest run: 2 files, 71 tests passed.
- ⚠️ `tsc --noEmit` fails due to unrelated `moonshot` provider files that were broken by the provider rename in the cherry-picked provider fix. The files added/changed in this task are type-clean.

## Issues Discovered
- `src/api/providers/moonshot.ts` and `src/api/providers/__tests__/moonshot.spec.ts` are currently broken against the new `OpenAICompatibleHandler` API. They still import `OpenAiCompatibleHandler` and `OpenAiCompatibleHandlerOptions`, which no longer exist. This is out of scope for the test-file-only task but will block a full build/CI until addressed.

## Next Step Recommendations
- VP should decide whether to include the moonshot compatibility fix in PR B or a follow-up PR.
- Once the moonshot build break is resolved, re-run `cd src; npx tsc --noEmit` for a clean type-check.

## Affected File List
- `src/api/providers/__tests__/openai-compatible.spec.ts` (created)
- `src/api/providers/__tests__/openai.spec.ts` (modified)
