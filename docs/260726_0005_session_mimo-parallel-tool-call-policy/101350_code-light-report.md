# Code-Light Task Report

## Task Summary
Add a flaky-test documentation comment to the "interrupted child resumes and reports back to parent" E2E test to trigger a CI re-run.

## Actions Taken
1. Confirmed branch `feat/error-interception-middleware` was already checked out.
2. Located the target test at line 694 of `apps/vscode-e2e/src/suite/subtasks.test.ts`.
3. Added a 3-line `NOTE` comment above the existing Issue #560 comment block, referencing the debug-systemic report 190600.
4. Committed as `docs: add flaky-test note for interrupted-child E2E` (commit `5c8c495e0`).
5. Pushed to `myk1yt/feat/error-interception-middleware` with `--force-with-lease`.

## Result
✅ Success — commit pushed. CI should trigger a new run automatically.

## Issues Discovered
None.

## Next Step Recommendations
Monitor the new CI run. If the "interrupted child resumes and reports back to parent" test flakes again, follow the guidance in the comment and the referenced debug-systemic report 190600 to tighten the fixture predicate chain.

## Affected File List
- `apps/vscode-e2e/src/suite/subtasks.test.ts` (comment-only addition, lines 691–693)
