# Code Task Report: Combined Branch Merge + VSIX Build

## Task Summary
Combine 5 feature branches into `feature/combined-all-features`, build VSIX, and install it.

## Actions Taken

### Step 1: Branch Check
- `feature/combined-all-features` already existed locally.
- Discovered the local default branch is `master` (not `main`), and there are two remotes: `myk1yt` and `upstream`.
- The 5 feature branches share NO common ancestor with `master` (different root commits). They were created from a different repository clone.
- The feature branches DO share common ancestors among themselves.

### Step 2: Branch Setup
- Reset `feature/combined-all-features` to `feat/error-interception-middleware` as the base (since all 5 branches share ancestry with it, but not with `master`).

### Step 3: Merge Results

| # | Branch | Result |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | `feat/error-interception-middleware` | ✅ Base (reset to this) |
| 2 | `feature/unified-shell-resolution` | ✅ Merged cleanly (no conflicts) |
| 3 | `feature/local-usage-stats` | ❌ CONFLICTS - merge aborted |
| 4 | `feature/task-dnd-ux` | ❌ CONFLICTS - merge aborted |
| 5 | `fix/mimo-parallel-tool-call-policy` | ❌ CONFLICTS - merge aborted |

### Conflict Details

**Branch 3: `feature/local-usage-stats`** - Conflicted files:
- `packages/types/src/vscode-extension-host.ts`
- `src/core/task/Task.ts`
- `src/core/tools/ExecuteCommandTool.ts`
- `src/core/tools/__tests__/executeCommandTool.spec.ts`
- `src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts`
- `src/integrations/terminal/TerminalProcess.ts`

**Branch 4: `feature/task-dnd-ux`** - Conflicted files:
- `packages/types/src/vscode-extension-host.ts`

**Branch 5: `fix/mimo-parallel-tool-call-policy`** - Conflicted files:
- `src/core/prompts/tools/native-tools/execute_command.ts`

## Result
**PARTIAL** - Only 2 of 5 branches merged successfully. 3 branches have conflicts requiring manual resolution. VSIX build and install steps were NOT reached.

## Issues Discovered
1. **Unrelated histories**: The 5 feature branches have no common ancestor with `master`. They appear to originate from a different fork/clone of the repository. This is why `git merge` from `master` fails with "refusing to merge unrelated histories."
2. **Cross-branch conflicts**: The `feature/unified-shell-resolution` branch made extensive changes to terminal/execute-command infrastructure that conflict with changes in `feature/local-usage-stats`, `feature/task-dnd-ux`, and `fix/mimo-parallel-tool-call-policy`.
3. The primary conflict point is `packages/types/src/vscode-extension-host.ts` which is modified by multiple branches.

## Next Step Recommendations
1. **VP decision needed**: Should conflicts be resolved manually? The conflicts are in shared infrastructure files (terminal, execute-command, vscode-extension-host types) and require careful manual resolution.
2. Alternatively, consider merging branches in a different order or using `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag if merging from `master` is required.
3. After conflict resolution, proceed with `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, `npx vsce package`, and `code --install-extension`.
