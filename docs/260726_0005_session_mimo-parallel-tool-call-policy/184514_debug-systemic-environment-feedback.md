## Issue: Native semantic search, E2E launch environment, and memory tool validation failures

### Problem Description
- What happened: The required native semantic search failed while locating the tool-call parsing and error-interception implementation.
- When it occurred: During systemic tracing after reading the E2E fixture and test.
- Error messages:
  - `Failed to create embeddings after 3 attempts: fetch failed`
  - `Code index is not ready for search. Current state: Error`
  - Targeted E2E launch failed before extension activation with `Cannot find module 'C:\Users\k1yt\AppData\Local\Temp\roo-test-workspace-...'`.
  - Crow recall rejected `register: "code"` because the accepted register values are the individual code registers or `all`.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Why it happened: The local embedding endpoint used by `codebase_search` was unavailable or unreachable. The failure occurred before repository search results could be produced and is independent of the tested extension logic.
- E2E launcher issue: The terminal inherited `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` and `VSCODE_ESM_ENTRYPOINT=vs/workbench/api/node/extensionHostProcess`. Those variables forced the downloaded VS Code executable into Node/extension-host behavior, causing the temporary workspace path passed by [`runTests()`](apps/vscode-e2e/src/runTest.ts:176) to be interpreted as a module. This was an inherited environment failure, not a defect in the workspace launch argument.
- Memory tool issue: I confused the `domain: "code"` shortcut with the `register` enumeration. This was a caller parameter error.

### Workaround/Solution
- How I solved it: Continued with targeted native regex search, then read only the matching code ranges. Removed `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` and `VSCODE_ESM_ENTRYPOINT` from the child process environment before launching E2E tests. Future code-only memory recalls will use `domain: "code"` with a valid individual register or `register: "all"`.
- What I tried: Two correctly parameterized `codebase_search` requests. The second confirmed that the index remained in an error state, so no further semantic-search retries will be made during this task.
- Targeted E2E verification: After clearing the inherited Electron variables, the exact interrupted-child test passed once and the complete [`subtasks.test.ts`](apps/vscode-e2e/src/suite/subtasks.test.ts) suite passed twice with all 9 tests.

### Ideal Environment
- What would be ideal: The local embedding endpoint should be health-checked before dispatching semantic searches, with automatic fallback to indexed textual search when unavailable.

### Additional Notes
- The semantic-search failure did not affect the eventual E2E verification. The corrected launch environment allowed the reported test path to execute successfully.
