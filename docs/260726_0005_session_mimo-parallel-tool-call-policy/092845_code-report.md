# Code Task Report: Intentional Breakage Verification

## Task Summary
Temporarily introduced a controlled mistake in the error interceptor output format in [`src/core/tools/error-interception/MessageTransformer.ts`](src/core/tools/error-interception/MessageTransformer.ts:307) to verify that `error-interceptor-guided-format.integration.spec.ts` catches real failures, then immediately reverted it.

## Actions Taken
1. Read [`formatPayloadAsDetails()`](src/core/tools/error-interception/MessageTransformer.ts:303) in [`src/core/tools/error-interception/MessageTransformer.ts`](src/core/tools/error-interception/MessageTransformer.ts).
2. Temporarily changed the Category line from `Category: ${payload.category}` to `Category: WRONG_${payload.category}` on line 307.
3. Ran the integration test:
   - `cd src; npx vitest run core/assistant-message/__tests__/error-interceptor-guided-format.integration.spec.ts`
4. Verified the test failed with 4 assertion errors, all clearly pointing at the wrong `Category` prefix.
5. Reverted line 307 to the original `Category: ${payload.category}`.
6. Ran the integration test again and verified all 5 tests pass.

## Result
✅ Success — the test correctly caught the intentional mistake and recovered after the revert. The code is now in the exact original state (no intentional mistake remains).

## Issues Discovered
None. The integration test responded as expected.

## Failure Evidence (From Step 3)

The test suite failed 4/5 tests. Representative failure messages:

- `Error Interceptor Guided Format Integration — INVALID_JSON_ARGUMENTS` > `real interceptor produces <error_details> format (not JSON)`
  - AssertionError: expected `<error_details>...` to contain `Category: INVALID_JSON_ARGUMENTS`
  - Received contained `Category: WRONG_INVALID_JSON_ARGUMENTS`

- `guided format consistency: INVALID_JSON_ARGUMENTS matches E2E fixture expectations` > `produces 'Category:' and 'Pattern:' substrings that the E2E fixture expects (not JSON)`
  - AssertionError: expected `'WRONG_INVALID_JSON_ARGUMENTS'` to be `'INVALID_JSON_ARGUMENTS'` // Object.is equality

- `DIFF_MATCH_FAILED pattern also produces human-readable format (cross-pattern consistency)`
  - AssertionError: expected `<error_details>...` to contain `Category: DIFF_MATCH_FAILED`
  - Received contained `Category: WRONG_DIFF_MATCH_FAILED`

All failures were caused by the single temporary `WRONG_` prefix in the `Category` line, proving the test asserts the exact human-readable format rather than just presence of any category substring.

## Pass Evidence (From Step 6)

```
Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  5 passed (5)
```

## Affected File List
- [`src/core/tools/error-interception/MessageTransformer.ts`](src/core/tools/error-interception/MessageTransformer.ts:307) — temporarily modified, then reverted to original state.

## Next Step Recommendations
No further action required. The integration test is confirmed to catch real format regressions in the error interceptor's `<error_details>` output.
