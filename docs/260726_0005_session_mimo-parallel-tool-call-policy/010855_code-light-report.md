# Code Light Task Report: .roomodes File Origin Investigation

## Task Summary
Investigated the origin, git history, and current status of the `.roomodes` file in the ZooCode workspace.

## Actions Taken
1. Ran `git log --oneline --all -- .roomodes` to check full git history
2. Checked `git show main:.roomodes` (failed — local default branch is `master`, not `main`)
3. Checked `git show master:.roomodes` (empty — file does NOT exist on local `master`)
4. Checked `git show upstream/main:.roomodes` (EXISTS — file is present on `upstream/main`)
5. Searched `.gitignore` for "roomodes" — no match
6. Checked file creation time via `(Get-Item .roomodes).CreationTime`
7. Checked `git ls-files .roomodes` — confirmed file is tracked on current branch
8. Read full file content (149 lines)
9. Identified the initial commit that added `.roomodes`: `00bf91470` ("Add i18n")

## Result
**Success** — Complete origin analysis performed.

## Key Findings

### 1. Git History (10+ commits touching `.roomodes`)

| `6cfa82f57` | Revert to pre-AI-SDK state (January 29, 2026) (#11462) |
| `d2c52c9e0` | chore: clean up repo-facing mode rules (#11410) |

| `82a321218` | docs: update docs extractor mode configuration and rules (#6373) |
| `e117208c2` | Command argument hints and change release engineer to a command (#6333) |

**Initial commit**: `00bf91470` ("Add i18n") — this is when `.roomodes` was first added.

### 2. Branch Presence
| Branch | `.roomodes` exists? |
|--------|---------------------|
| `master` (local default) | **NO** — file does not exist |
| `upstream/main` (remote) | **YES** — file exists with content |
| `feature/combined-all-features` (current) | **YES** — file is tracked |

### 3. .gitignore Status
**NOT in `.gitignore`** — no match found for "roomodes" pattern.

### 4. File Creation Date (local working copy)
**2026-07-27 08:56:42 KST** (today, created on this machine)

### 5. File Content Summary
- **149 lines** of YAML
- Defines 7 custom modes under `customModes:` key:
  - `translate` — 🌐 Translate (localization management)
  - `issue-fixer` — 🔧 Issue Fixer (GitHub issue resolution)
  - `pr-fixer` — 🛠️ PR Fixer (pull request fixes)
  - `merge-resolver` — 🔀 Merge Resolver (merge conflict resolution)
  - `docs-extractor` — 📚 Docs Extractor (codebase fact extraction)
  - `issue-investigator` — 🕵️ Issue Investigator (GitHub issue triage)
  - `issue-writer` — 📝 Issue Writer (GitHub issue creation)
- All modes reference "Zoo" or "Zoo Code" branding (renamed from Roo Code in commit `348f8e13d`)
- All modes have `source: project` marker (project-level custom modes, not user-level)

### 6. Origin Analysis
The `.roomodes` file originates from the **upstream Roo Code repository** (now rebranded as ZooCode). Key evidence:
- The file first appeared in commit `00bf91470` ("Add i18n") in the upstream history
- It exists on `upstream/main` but NOT on the local `master` branch
- The local `master` branch appears to be an older or diverged fork point
- The `feature/combined-all-features` branch (current) was rebased/merged with upstream, picking up `.roomodes`
- Commit `348f8e13d` renamed all "Roo" references to "Zoo" in the file
- The file is a **Roo Code convention** for defining project-level custom agent modes

## Issues Discovered
None — investigation completed cleanly.

## Affected File List
- `.roomodes` (read-only investigation, no modifications made)

## Next Step Recommendations
- If VP needs to ensure `.roomodes` is on `master`, a merge/rebase from `upstream/main` would be needed (out of code-light scope)
- The file is already tracked on the current branch and will be included in any commits on `feature/combined-all-features`
